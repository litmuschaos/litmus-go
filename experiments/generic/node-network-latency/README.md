 <td> Node Network Latency </td>
 <td> This experiment causes flaky access to the target nodes by injecting network delay. This is achieved by starting a traffic control (tc) process (on the helper container with hostNetwork true) running  with netem rules to add egress delays. This experiment can test the node's resilience accessibility under network latency </td>
