 <td> Spring Boot App Kill </td>
 <td> This experiment allows injecting Chaos Monkey app-kill assaults on Spring Boot applications, which have the [Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot](https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/) in their classpath. It can target random pods with a Spring Boot application and allows configuring the assaults to inject app-kill. It tests the resiliency of the system when some applications are having unexpected faulty behavior.</td>
