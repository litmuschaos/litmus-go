<tr>
 <td> Spring Boot App Kill </td>
 <td> This experiment allows injecting Chaos Monkey app-kill assaults on Spring Boot applications, which have the [Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot](https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/) in their classpath. It can target random pods with a Spring Boot application and allows configuring the assaults to inject app-kill. It tests the resiliency of the system when some applications are having unexpected faulty behavior.</td>
 <td>  TODO </td>

<tr>
 <td> Spring Boot CPU Stress </td>
 <td> This experiment allows injecting Chaos Monkey cpu-stress assaults on Spring Boot applications, which have the [Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot](https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/) in their classpath. It can target random pods with a Spring Boot application and allows configuring the assaults to inject cpu-stress. It tests the resiliency of the system when some applications are having unexpected faulty behavior.</td>

<tr>
 <td> Spring Boot Memory Stress </td>
 <td> This experiment allows injecting Chaos Monkey memory-stress assaults on Spring Boot applications, which have the [Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot](https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/) in their classpath. It can target random pods with a Spring Boot application and allows configuring the assaults to inject memory-stress. It tests the resiliency of the system when some applications are having unexpected faulty behavior.</td>

<tr>
 <td> Spring Boot Latency </td>
 <td> This experiment allows injecting Chaos Monkey latency assaults on Spring Boot applications, which have the [Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot](https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/) in their classpath. It can target random pods with a Spring Boot application and allows configuring the assaults to inject network latency. It tests the resiliency of the system when some applications are having unexpected faulty behavior.</td>
 <td>  TODO </td>

<tr>
 <td> Spring Boot Exceptions </td>
 <td> This experiment allows injecting Chaos Monkey exceptions assaults on Spring Boot applications, which have the [Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot](https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/) in their classpath. It can target random pods with a Spring Boot application and allows configuring the assaults to inject exceptions. It tests the resiliency of the system when some applications are having unexpected faulty behavior.</td>
 <td>  TODO </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
 <td> Spring Boot Faults </td>
 <td> This experiment allows injecting Chaos Monkey faults assaults on Spring Boot applications, which have the [Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot](https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/) in their classpath. It can target random pods with a Spring Boot application and allows configuring the assaults to inject spring-boot faults. It tests the resiliency of the system when some applications are having unexpected faulty behavior.</td>
