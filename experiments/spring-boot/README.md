 <td> Chaos Monkey Spring Boot </td>
 <td> This experiment allows injecting Chaos Monkey assaults on Spring Boot applications which have the [Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot](https://codecentric.github.io/chaos-monkey-spring-boot/) in their classpath. It can target random pods with a Spring Boot application, and allows configuring the assults to inject (exception, latency, cpu, memory). It tests the resiliency of the system when some applications are having unexpected faulty behavior.</td>
