# Run E2E tests using GitHub Chaos Actions 

- When you commit code to your repository, you can continuously build and test the code to make sure that the commit doesn't introduce errors. The error could be in the form of some security issue, functional issue, or performance issue which can be tested using different custom tests, linters, or by pulling actions. This brings the need of having *Chaos Actions* which will perform a chaos test on the application over a particular commit which in-turn helps to track the performance of the application on a commit level. This can be done by commenting on the Pull Request. 

## Through comments on PR

- We can run tests for any desired experiment or set of experiments by just commenting on the Pull Request. The format of comment will be:

```bash

/run-e2e-<test-name/test-group>

```

## Merge a Pull Request

- For auto merging, we need to comment `/merge` in the PR which will add a label  `merge` in the PR and then finally merge the PR according to the ENVs provided.

_Minimum Number of Approvals:_

- The action will automatically check if the required number of review approvals has been reached. If the number is not reached, it will not merge the PR.

- It will work according to the role of the commenter and branch protection Rule on the repository.
